# Inscryption-EveryCardGetsATribe

## (WIP) bugs, missing art

Mod for inscryption adding tribes to every card, including all temples and acts, adding them to act-1 (tribes do NOT work outside of act-1). Thanks to [Tribal Libary](https://thunderstore.io/c/inscryption/p/The_Unwanted_but_Useful_Libraries/Tribal_Libary/)'s creator and Inscryption PvP for most tribe ideas and current placeholder tribe icons.

I hope for this to be usable as a standard for adding other temples to act-1 or Kaycee's mod! If you wish to use this, contact me (@aubrey69) on discord for more information, but;
- The GUID for the mod is `omnitemplecabin`, so if you wish to use the tribes you must put `omnitemplecabin.<TRIBE NAME>` tribe names are as follows, separated by temple:
  - conduits, utility, security, protectors
  - spectral, skeletal, possessed, fleshy
  - scholar, guardian, gems, mystic
